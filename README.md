# Credit-Card-Approval
Aims to decide weather the credit card application is accepted or rejected


### Credit Card Approval Using Machine Learning

Evaluating thousands of credit card applications is a complex task that requires careful analysis of each applicant's financial history. Fortunately, machine learning offers a powerful and efficient solution to support decision-making in the banking sector.
I recently completed a real-world project on DataCamp focused on predicting credit card approvals using classification models. The goal was to classify each application as approved or rejected based on various financial indicators.

### Key Insights:
* Removing categorical variables with more than 10 unique values helped improve model performance.

* As expected, the Random Forest Classifier slightly outperformed Logistic Regression, providing better accuracy and robustness.

This project reinforced the value of machine learning in automating high-stakes financial decisions with speed, reliability, and scalability. 

Looking forward to applying these skills to real-world business challenges!
